# Simulation of Gravitational Quantities w/ Python and Pygame

This is a simulation of four important gravitational quantities: gravitational force, gravitational potential energy, gravitational potential, and gravitational field strength. I made it in consultation with my high school physics teacher, Mr. Onur Gundogdu, and it's aimed to help students make abstract concepts more understandable.

#### How to Run This Code
The code for this project was written using the PyGame library, so that would be required to run the program. I'll soon release this as a webpage that could be easily accesed by students and teachers alike.

#### YouTube Video
I made a YouTube video on how I went about building this project, which was my first independent simulation project. Check it out at https://youtu.be/mucb0HKRuZU?si=XSpiBKtlv2r1DVuA.
